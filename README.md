## About UltrasHub

UltrasHub is a UI wrapper around [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/). We try to be different from sources like ESPN and Sky Sports, by our main objective of getting you the information you need as fast as possible. UltrasHub also allows you to easily view the teams and competitons that you care about.

## Bug Report or Feature Request

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, [send us an email](mailto:contact@ultrashub.io) or [create an issue](https://github.com/navazjm/ultrashub/issues), [create a discussion thread](https://github.com/navazjm/ultrashub/discussions).

## Product Roadmap

This roadmap contains all improvements and new features we plan for UltrasHub.

Check the [Kanban board in this project](https://github.com/users/navazjm/projects/2/views/2) for an overview.

Note: This roadmap is only the improvements and new features and not the bugs. We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new
issue](https://github.com/navazjm/ultrashub/issues/new); it's that easy!

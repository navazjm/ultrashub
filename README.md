## About UltrasHub

UltrasHub is a UI wrapper around [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/). We try to be different from sources like ESPN and Sky Sports, by our main objective of getting you the information you need as fast as possible. UltrasHub also allows you to easily view the teams and competitons that you care about.
